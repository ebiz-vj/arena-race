🎮 GAME MASTER PLAN
Arena Race – The Web3 Skill League
________________________________________
1️⃣ Core Positioning
Arena Race is:
A fast-paced, 4-player tactical board competition platform powered by NFT League Passes and stablecoin prize pools.
It is positioned as:
•	Competitive skill league
•	Esports-lite Web3 platform
•	Tournament-based
•	Not gambling
•	Not betting
•	Not yield farming
________________________________________
2️⃣ Core Gameplay Design
🧩 Board Structure
•	7x7 tactical grid
•	4 players per match
•	Each player controls 3 tokens
•	5-minute timed matches
•	Objective: maximize score before timer ends
No dice.
No hidden randomness.
Pure decision-based system.
________________________________________
⚡ Energy-Based Movement System
Each turn:
•	Player receives 5 Energy Points
•	Movement costs 1 energy per tile
•	Special abilities cost 2–3 energy
Energy resets every turn.
This ensures:
•	Constant decisions
•	No passive turns
•	No RNG luck
________________________________________
🧠 Tactical Abilities
Basic Tier Abilities:
•	🚀 Boost (+2 movement)
•	🔒 Block (freeze tile)
•	🪤 Trap (temporary penalty tile)
Higher Tier Abilities (unlocked in higher leagues):
•	🔄 Swap positions
•	🧱 Defensive shield
•	⚡ Energy steal
Abilities create fun chaos while maintaining skill dominance.
________________________________________
3️⃣ Win Conditions
Primary Model: Timed Score System
Match lasts 5 minutes.
Score earned by:
•	Board position
•	Overtakes
•	Tactical plays
•	Survival bonuses
•	Control zones
At timer end:
1st = 100 pts
2nd = 60 pts
3rd = 40 pts
4th = 20 pts
No instant win lottery mechanics.
________________________________________
4️⃣ Hardening Levels (Skill Divisions)
ELO-based ranking system:
•	🟤 Bronze
•	⚪ Silver
•	🟡 Gold
•	🔵 Platinum
•	🔴 Diamond
Players compete within their tier.
Promotion requires:
•	Win streak
•	Minimum rating threshold
This prevents:
•	Beginners being crushed
•	Pros farming new players
This keeps game interesting long term.
________________________________________
5️⃣ Entry Price Segmented Pools
Each division has multiple entry price pools:
Pool	Entry	Audience
Casual	10 USDC	Entry players
Standard	25 USDC	Regular
Pro	100 USDC	Skilled
Elite	500+ USDC	High-tier
Same rules.
Same mechanics.
Different prize pool size.
This avoids pay-to-win.
________________________________________
6️⃣ NFT League Pass Model
NFT = Season Access Pass.
Types:
•	Bronze Pass
•	Silver Pass
•	Gold Pass
Utility:
•	Required for tournament entry
•	Determines division access
•	Cosmetic identity
•	Badge of prestige
•	Tradable
NOT:
•	Revenue share
•	Yield
•	Dividend
•	Profit guarantee
This avoids securities classification.
________________________________________
7️⃣ Prize Pool Structure
Example:
100 players × 25 USDC = 2,500 USDC
Platform fee 8% = 200 USDC
Prize pool = 2,300 USDC
Distribution model:
•	Top 5% → Large win
•	Top 25% → Moderate win
•	Top 40% → Break-even tier
•	Others → XP + rating growth
Very few feel “zeroed.”
Encourages replay.
________________________________________
8️⃣ Compliance Architecture
To support Dubai structure:
•	Skill-dominant mechanics
•	No dice randomness
•	No jackpot marketing
•	Tournament framing
•	Clear rulebook
•	Transparent smart contract escrow
•	Stablecoin only (USDC)
•	Optional KYC for high-tier pools
•	Geo-block high-risk jurisdictions if needed
Positioning:
“Competitive Skill League”
Not casino.
Not betting.

9️⃣ Smart Contract Structure
Escrow Vault Model:
1.	Players register via NFT pass
2.	Stablecoin entry sent to smart contract
3.	Platform fee auto-calculated
4.	Prize distribution auto-executed

“Your tactical efficiency dropped 6% this season.”
Different emotional tone.
Same core game.
________________________________________
🏰 Clan Layer Bridges Both
Clans can have:
•	Casual clan tournaments
•	Competitive clan wars
Within same ecosystem.
Casual players stay for social.
Competitive players stay for prestige.
________________________________________
🧠 Why This Is Powerful
Games that survive long-term:
•	Start friendly
•	Mature competitive
•	Allow players to choose intensity
Examples of this model:
•	Fortnite

•	Esports ladders
Surface is fun.
Core is brutal.
________________________________________
🏆 How You Implement It Technically

•	Pro theme (clean esports style)
Unlocked by tier.
________________________________________
2️⃣ Chat Evolution

________________________________________
3️⃣ Match Display
Casual:
•	Fun animations

________________________________________
🚨 One Important Rule
You must not mix them inside same pool.
Never let:
Friendly Bronze player
Into
Intense Diamond pool
That kills retention.
________________________________________
🧱 Final Social Architecture
Arena Race becomes:
•	Casual on entry
•	Competitive on climb
•	Social at clan level
•	Intense at elite level
One ecosystem.
Two emotional experiences.
